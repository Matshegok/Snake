- Dealing with the direction

- 4 directions:
    - up 
    - down 
    - left 
    - right



    - What have we acheived right now? 
        1. I can Add an arbitrary vector to the body array 
        2. When the snake moves that is when the body properly updates
        3. 


    - Trying to figure out?
        - The exact components where to add the tail part 
        - I could create a method that is going to analyse the tail and then from it we get the coordinates
