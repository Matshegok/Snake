- Planning out the addBody method: 

    Problem: When we "a" for add, the body of the snake must increase 

    - whole_body list
    - Direction

    [v1, v2, v3, v4]
    - what are the coordinates of v4?
    - check the last two vectors 
    - allocate coordinates to v4

    [v1] moving down -> y-1 
    [v1] moving up -> y+1
    [v1] moving right -> x-1
    [v1] moving left -> x+1

    [v1, v2] moving ->
