- what Am I trying to achieve?
    - Trying to implement drawing the snake with the body implemented 
- How should we go about this?
    - I think that I should start with a snake body of about 3
- How do we achieve this?
    - remove all the clutter in the code
    - Create a list with the snake bodys 
    - Find a Way to successfully print them on the screen by looping through the list
    - After this you can work on the snake movement
